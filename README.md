# Emergency Department Simulation

This repository contains a discrete-event simulation model for simulating the performance and capacity of an Emergency Department (ED) in a hospital. The simulation helps evaluate patient wait times, resource utilization, and system bottlenecks in order to inform decisions on resource allocation and staffing levels.

## Project Overview

The Emergency Department Simulation model is designed to simulate patient flow through two areas of the ED:
- **Fast Track**: For minor injuries and illnesses.
- **Main ED**: For more critical and complex cases.

The goal of this simulation is to evaluate how the system performs under varying conditions (e.g., increased patient volume) and to design the appropriate capacity to meet future demands.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. The following Python libraries are required to run the simulation:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `simpy`

### Install Dependencies

To install all the necessary dependencies, use the `requirements.txt` file:
